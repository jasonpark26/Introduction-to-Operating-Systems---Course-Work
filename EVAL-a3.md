## Assignment #3 evaluation

* Name: `Jason Park`
* VNum: `V00946007`
* Netlink: `jasonpark`

The evaluation of your third assignment has used a somewhat different
process than for the previous two. That is, earlier the teaching team
used individual tests to probe for and determine whether specific
behavior was present in submitted work.

For this assignment we used all of the tests plus two additional ones
(all of which can be found in `a3-testing-stuff.zip` at Brightspace)
to consider the overall behavor of your multi-level-feedback-queue
simulation. The test cases had been crafted in such a way as to reduce
or eliminate ambiguity in scheduling, although this of course may have
occurred in ways we didn't foresee.

Therefore what you are now receiving is a more general evaluation
which considers how closely your simulation's results match what was
expected. (Note that the `ZIP` file mentioned above also includes some
expected results.) Additional comments on and observations about your
submitted code may also be provided.

### Preliminaries

* `mlfq.c` submitted and compiles : **The program compiled successfully.**
* `README.md` (or equivalent) provided which is also helpful: **`README.md` file provided.
Readme file provides an overview of the implementation.**


---
### Running of simulations

* Running of simulation 1: **The program generates correct output.**
* Running of simulation 2: **The program generates correct output.**
* Running of simulation 3: **The program generates correct output.**
* Running of simulation 4: **Small error in the program output. Task priority is reduced before the completion of the current quantum.**
* Running of simulation 5: **The program output is incorrect.
Incorrect values for WT and TAT.**


---
### Other comments

* Comments after reading of code:  **Well structured well documented code.**
* Any other comments: **Good effort on the assignment.**

---
### Grade for submitted work (either letter or out of 100)
* **B+**
